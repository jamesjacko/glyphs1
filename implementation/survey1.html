			<h1>Glyph Based Visualisation Study</h1>
			<p>We have created a system which generates glyph small, discrete, visualisations (glyphs). This study will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of the generated glyphs. The study is split into three parts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Evalute the glyphs effectiveness of depicting data 1. You will be asked to differentiate depictions of small values against those with high values.</li>
				<li>Evalute the glyphs effectiveness of depicting data 2. You will be asked to order sequence of glyphs from low to high.</li>
				<li>Evalute your feelings towards each glyph type. You will be asked to rate a particular glypoh based on its appeal and ability to portray the information.</li>
			</ol>
