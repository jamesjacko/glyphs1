			<h1>Glyph Based Visualisation Study</h1>
			<p><strong>Please read the following carefully.</strong></p>
			<p>The Visualisation Modelling Graphics research group in Bangor University is working on a system for producing micro visualisations using a novel technique. You can find out more about the study <a href="http://vmg.cs.bangor.ac.uk/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			<p>We have created a system which generates small, discrete, visualisations. This study will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of the generated visualisations. The study is split into three parts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Evalute the visualisations effectiveness of depicting data 1. You will be asked to differentiate depictions of small values against those with high values.</li>
				<li>Evalute the visualisations effectiveness of depicting data 2. You will be asked to order sequence of glyphs from low to high.</li>
				<li>You will be asked for your opinions on the visualisations that you have surveyed and your thoughts on the method as a whole.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>Please indicate you consent for your data to be used</h2>

			<p><label for="consent">I am happy for my responses to be used in the survey and for future work</label><input type="checkbox" id="consent" name="consent"></input></p>
			<p>Please indicate whether you have taken part in the study before or not.</p>
