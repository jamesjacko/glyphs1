			<h1>Glyph Based Visualisation Study</h1>
			<p>The Visualisation and Medical Graphics group is working on a system for producing micro visualisations using a novel technique. You can find out more about the study <a href="#" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			<p>We have created a system which generates small, discrete, visualisations. This study will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of the generated visualisations. The study is split into three parts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Evalute the visualisations effectiveness of depicting data 1. You will be asked to differentiate depictions of small values against those with high values.</li>
				<li>Evalute the visualisations effectiveness of depicting data 2. You will be asked to order sequence of glyphs from low to high.</li>
				<li>Evalute your feelings towards each glyph type. You will be asked to rate a particular visualisation based on its appeal and ability to portray the information.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Please indicate whether you have taken part in the study before or not</p>
